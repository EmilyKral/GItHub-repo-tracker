# LAP 3 Code Challenge - GitHub Repositories

A React app that makes use of the GitHub API to fetch and display information about a user and their
repositories. Completed for LAP 3 assignment week as part of futureproof's Conway cohort.

## Installation and Usage

**Installation**

- Clone or download the repo
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies

**Usage**

- Run `npm run dev` to open the app in your browser at 0.0.0.0:8080

## Challenges and Achievements

**Challenges**

- Learning how to use contexts to store the username and make it accessible to other components in
  the app.
- Making a fetch request to the server using useEffect only when the username was changed and not on
  the initial load of the page

**Achievements**

- Successfully using useContext to store and access the username
- Using different branches of the GitHub API to retrieve multiple sets of data and then passing
  those down as props to the different components.
